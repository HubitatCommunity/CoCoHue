(Hue Bridge Integration App for Hubitat)

This is a Hue Bridge integration designed to replace (or supplement) Hubitat's buit-in Hue Bridge
integration. It provides several advantages, including:
1. Access to Hue bulb "effects" (color loop, select/alert, etc.)
2. Improved group support ("Change Level" capability--`startLevelChagne` and stopLevelChange` commands implemented)
3. Coming soon: scene support!
4. It's open source! Customize the code to suit your requirements.

For discussion and more information, visit the Hubitat Community forum thread (link coming soon).

## To Install
1. Back up your hub and save a local copy before proceeding.

2. Install the parent and child apps from the "apps" folder in this repository into the "Apps Code" section of Hubitat: 
    * Install the parent app code: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RMoRobert/CoCoHue/master/apps/cocohue-parent-app.groovy    
    * Install the child app code: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RMoRobert/CoCoHue/master/apps/cocohue-bridge-child-app.groovy

3. Install all necessary drivers from the "drivers" folder in this repository into the "Drivers Code" section of Hubitat. (There aren't very many, so I'd recommend just installing them all, but technically all you need is the Bridge driver plus the driver for any device types you plan to use.)
    * Install the Bridge driver code: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RMoRobert/CoCoHue/master/drivers/cocohue-bridge-driver.groovy
    * Install the bulb, group, and scene drivers:
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RMoRobert/CoCoHue/master/drivers/cocohue-rgbw-bulb-driver.groovy,
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RMoRobert/CoCoHue/master/drivers/cocohue-group-driver.groovy,
    (more coming soon)

4. Install an instance of app: go to **Apps > Add User App**, choose **CoCoHue**, and follow the prompts. At the moment, your
   Hue Bridge needs a static IP address, as discovery is not supported.

## Feature Documentation
CoCoHue is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Hubitat's existing Hue integration. If any devices behave differently, this
may be considered a bug. Please report any such behavior in the Community forum. This integration extends built-in functionality,
and notes on these features are below:

1. Prestaging: this integration adds color and level prestaging options to mimic those found in many other native drivers.
This means that if a `setLevel` (for level prestaging) or a `setColorTemperature`, `setColor`, `setHue`, or
`setSaturation` command are received when the bulb is off, it will not turn on. Instead, the next time the bulb is turned on, it will be turned on with those settings. This works well if your bulbs are manipulated entirely from Hubitat. Unfortunately,
Hue itself does not support prestaging on the Bridge (these prestaged settings are "remembered" entirely on the
Hubitat device), so this will *not* work if you prestage in Hubitat and then turn the bulbs on outside of Hubitat.
(Recommendation: manipulate bulbs only from Hubitat if prestaging is enabled.)

2. Color loop effect: to fit in with Hubitat's "Light Effects" capability, Hue's only effect, `colorloop`, is implemented using
this capability. It is effect `1`. It can be activated by calling the standard command, `setEffect(1)`. "None" is implemented
as effect `0`, so the effect can be cancelled by calling `setEffect(0)`. The `nextEffect` and `previousEffect` commands are
pretty boring for this reason, but they are part of the standard Hubitat capability as it is currently documented. Setting
a color, hue, or color temperature will also cancel the effect (this is consistent with the behavior of other bulbs I tested).
Setting a level or saturation will *not* because Hue allows adjustment of these while the effect (which does not manipulate these
values) is in progress.

3. "Select" and "LSelect" alerts: these are basically a one-time flash and a 15-time flash. These are implemented as the
`flashOnce()` command and the pseudo-standard `flash()` command, respectively.

4. Groups: besides "Change Level" (implemnted here), it appears that a Hubitat Hue group is smart enough to know which
Hue bulbs are contained as members and adjusts their state without them needing to be updated via a Bridge poll. This
will be coming soon here.

5. Scenes: implemented as button and switch devices. To activate, do a `push(1)` or an `on()` command (the `off()` command
has no effect but can be used if desired without harm). If you use scenes, it is recommended to keep polling enabled (a
good idea regardless, though if bulb devices are manipulated only through Hubitat it may not be necessary).
