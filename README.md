(Hue Bridge Integration App for Hubitat)

## To Install
1. Install the parent and child apps from the "apps" folder in this repository into the "Apps Code" section of Hubitat.

2. Install all necessary drivers from the "drivers" folder in this repository into the "Drivers Code" section of Hubitat. (There aren't very many, so I'd recommend just installing them all, but technically all you need is the Bridge driver plus the driver for any device types you plan to use.)

3. Install the app: go to Apps > Add User App > CoCoHue, and follow the prompts.

More documentation coming soon.
